Hi Andro, Great job on this challenge, This is actually on of my most favourite challenges on this platform. There are three main issues with this solution :

-   Your project is not structured properly.
-   You took a wrong approach ( I explain why in depth )

Now I'm going explain each issue.

**1. Pages's layouts :**
